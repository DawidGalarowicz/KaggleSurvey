# Kaggle's ML and DS Survey 2019 - My Analysis

This repository contains a notebook that I have created to analyse results of Kaggle's Machine Learning and Data Science Survey from 2019. The data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019).

## Installation

The following libraries have been installed alongside a standard Anaconda distribution of Python:

```bash
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
mord
```

The code should run with no issues using Python 3.6.7.

## Project Motivation

This notebook has been created to better understand the community of Kaggle users. Using Python, I have investigated questions such as:
* Can we trust the data?
* Who are Kagglers?
* Where do they live?
* How much do they earn?
* Can we establish what factors influence their income?

## File Descriptions
Apart from the README file, there is only one notebook in this repository. It contains code to generate all outputs I have used to conduct my analysis.

## Results
A blog post discussing the main findings can be found here.

## Licensing & Acknowledgements
You can find the licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
