# Kaggle's ML and DS Survey 2019 - My Analysis

This repository contains a notebook that I have created to analyse results of Kaggle's Machine Learning and Data Science Survey from 2019. The data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019). I have also published a blog post on Medium outlining my conclusions which you can access by clicking [here](https://medium.com/@dawidgalarowicz/who-has-time-for-kaggle-challenges-63dbb0b0a757).

## Project Motivation

This notebook has been created to better understand the community of Kaggle users. Using Python, I have investigated questions such as:
* Can we trust the data?
* Who are Kagglers?
* Where do they live?
* How much do they earn?
* Can we establish what factors influence their income?
